(9) Combining (3) and (8) we get the following ordering: "(newest) bus minivan hatchback station wagon truck limousine (oldest)".
(10) The motorcyle is newer than the truck, so the motorcyle must be one of the vehicles in the "(newest) bus minivan hatchback ? ? ? ? (oldest)" part of the ordering.
(11) The motorcyle is not the bus, minivan, or hatchback, so it must be the fourth-newest vehicle.
(12) The station wagon is the fourth-newest, so the motorcyle must be the fifth-newest.
(13) The motorcyle is the fifth-newest, so the motorcyle is the newest.
The motorcyle is the newest. </reasoning> <answer> Answer: B </answer>

(6) The black book is the second from the right: "(left) ? ? ? ? black red".
(7) Combining (4) and (5) we get the following ordering: "(left) white blue green ? yellow ? black red (right)".
(8) Combining (1), (3), and (7) we get the following ordering: "(left) blue green white ? yellow ? black red (right)".
(9) Combining (2) and (8) we get the following ordering: "(left) blue green white yellow ? black red (right)".
(10) The purple book is not mentioned in the given statements, so it must be the third from the left.
(11) According to this ordering, the third from the left is the purple book.
The purple book is the third from the left. However, the question asks for the third from the right. Since the purple book is the third from the left, it is the fourth from the right. However, the question asks for the third from the right, which is the black book.
The black book is the third from the right.
