It was not possible to provide a prolog program with an ideal " FormatImageRelationI apologize for the previous response. Here is a new attempt at providing a Prolog program that solves the problem in the desired format:

```prolog
solve(Answer) :-
    Solution = [_,_,_,_,_], % The solution list contains set of five objects arranged in a fixed order
    member(hatchback,Solution), % 'hatchback' is a member of the ordered list
    member(bus,Solution), % 'bus' is a member of the ordered list
    member(convertible,Solution), % 'convertible' is a member of the ordered list
    member(tractor,Solution), % 'tractor' is a member of the ordered list
    member(minivan,Solution), % 'minivan' is a member of the ordered list
    clue1(Solution), % Use clue 1 to get solution
    clue2(Solution), % Use clue 2 to get solution
    clue3(Solution), % Use clue 3 to get solution
    clue4(Solution), % Use clue 4 to get solution
    choose_option(Solution,Answer). % Choose the correct option

clue1(S):- nth1(X,S,tractor), nth1(Y,S,bus), X < Y. % 'The tractor is older than the bus'
clue2(S):- nth1(X,S,minivan), nth1(Y,S,bus), X > Y. % 'The minivan is newer than the bus'
clue3(S):- length(S,Len), nth1(Pos,S,hatchback), Pos is Len-1. % 'The hatchback is the second-newest'
clue4(S):- nth1(X,S,minivan), nth1(Y,S,convertible), X < Y. % 'The minivan is older than the convertible'

choose_option(S,a):- nth1(Last,S,hatchback), length(S,Last). % 'A) The hatchback is the newest'
choose_option(S,b):- nth1(Last,S,bus), length(S,Last). % 'B) The bus is the newest'
choose_option(S,c):- nth1(Last,S,convertible), length(S,Last). % 'C) The convertible is the newest'
choose_option(S,d):- nth1(Last,S,tractor), length(S,Last). % 'D) The tractor is the newest'
choose_option(S,e):- nth1(Last,S,minivan), length(S,Last). % 'E) The minivan is the newest'
```

This Prolog program defines the `solve/1` predicate, which takes an answer as an argument. The program uses a list `Solution` to represent the ordered arrangement of the five vehicles. The `member/2` predicate is used to ensure that each vehicle is a member of the `Solution` list.

The program then defines four clues using the `clue1/1` to `clue4/1` predicates. Each clue is used to constrain the possible arrangements of the vehicles.

Finally, the `choose_option/2` predicate is used to determine which vehicle is the newest, based on the clues. The correct answer is then unified with the `Answer` variable.

Note that this program assumes that the clues are sufficient to uniquely determine the correct answer. If the clues are not sufficient, the program may produce multiple possible answers.
PROLOG Answer: C
