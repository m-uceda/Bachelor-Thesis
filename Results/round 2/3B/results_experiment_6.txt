Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph.

On a shelf, there are five books: a green book, a blue book, a white book, a purple book, and a yellow book. The blue book is to the right of the yellow book. The white book is to the left of the yellow book. The blue book is the second from the right. The purple book is the second from the left.
Options:
A) The green book is the second from the left.
B) The blue book is the second from the left.
C) The white book is the second from the left.
D) The purple book is the second from the left.
E) The yellow book is the second from the left.
Think step by step to solve this problem. After your reasoning, state your final answer in the format 'Answer: [letter]' on a new line.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

<reasoning>Let's think step by step.
(1) The blue book is to the right of the yellow book: "(left) ? yellow ? blue ? (right)".
(2) The white book is to the left of the yellow book: "(left) ? white ? yellow ? (right)".
(3) The blue book is the second from the right: "(left) ? ? ? blue ? (right)".
(4) The purple book is the second from the left: "(left) ? purple ? ? ? (right)".
(5) Combining (3) and (4) we get the following ordering: "(left) ? purple ? blue ? (right)".
(6) Combining (1), (2), and (5) we get the following ordering: "(left) white purple yellow blue green (right)".
According to this ordering, the second from the left is the purple book.
The purple book is the second from the left. </reasoning> <answer> Answer: D </answer><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph.

A fruit stand sells seven fruits: loquats, peaches, watermelons, plums, kiwis, mangoes, and pears. The pears are more expensive than the kiwis. The watermelons are less expensive than the peaches. The mangoes are the third-cheapest. The watermelons are the third-most expensive. The plums are the second-most expensive. The loquats are the second-cheapest.
Options:
A) The loquats are the third-most expensive.
B) The peaches are the third-most expensive.
C) The watermelons are the third-most expensive.
D) The plums are the third-most expensive.
E) The kiwis are the third-most expensive.
F) The mangoes are the third-most expensive.
G) The pears are the third-most expensive.

<reasoning> Let's think step by step.
(1) The pears are more expensive than the kiwis: "(cheap) ? ? kiwis ? pears ? ? (expensive)".
(2) The watermelons are less expensive than the peaches: "(cheap) ? ? watermelons ? peaches ? ? (expensive)".
(3) The mangoes are the third-cheapest: "(cheap) ? ? mangoes ? ? ? ?(expensive)".
(4) The watermelons are the third-most expensive: "(cheap) ? ? ? ?  watermelons ? ? (expensive)".
(5) The plums are the second-most expensive: "(cheap) ? ? ? ? ? plums ? (expensive)".
(6) The loquats are the second-cheapest: "(cheap) ? loquats ? ? ? ? ? (expensive)".
(7) Combining (3), (4), (5), and (6) we get the following ordering: "(cheap) ? loquats mangoes ? watermelons plums ? (expensive)".
(8) Combining (2) and (7) we get the following ordering: "(cheap) ? loquats mangoes ? watermelons plums peaches (expensive)".
(9) Combining (1) and (8) we get the following ordering: "(cheap) kiwis loquats mangoes pears watermelons plums peaches (expensive)".
According to this ordering, the third-most expensive fruit are watermelons.
The watermelons are the third-most expensive. </reasoning> <answer> Answer: C </answer><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>
