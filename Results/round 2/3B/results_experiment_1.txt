PROMPT MESSAGE STRUCTURE (role/content pairs):
[system] You are a Prolog program generator. Given a logical deduction problem with a context and multiple choice options, generate a Prolog program that solves the problem. Keep the order consistent (e.g., leftmost, newest, and first to arrive objects must be at the beginning of the Solution list, while rightmost, oldest and last to arrive should be at the end). Avoid errors by, for example, using 'Pos is Len-1' and 'nth1(Pos, S, X)' when an object X is said to be second from the right, or second oldest. Follow closely the format of the following example to solve the problem at the end in the same way. Generate the solution as a valid Prolog program starting with `solve(Answer) :-` and having the program enclosed in triple backticks labeled `prolog`.

[system] You are a Prolog program generator. Given a logical deduction problem with a context and multiple choice options, generate a Prolog program that solves the problem. Keep the order consistent (e.g., leftmost, newest, and first to arrive objects must be at the beginning of the Solution list, while rightmost, oldest and last to arrive should be at the end). Avoid errors by, for example, using 'Pos is Len-1' and 'nth1(Pos, S, X)' when an object X is said to be second from the right, or second oldest. Follow closely the format of the following example to solve the problem at the end in the same way.

PROMPT MESSAGE STRUCTURE (role/content pairs):
[system] You are a Prolog program generator. Given a logical deduction problem with a context and multiple choice options, generate a Prolog program that solves the problem. Keep the order consistent (e.g., leftmost, newest, and first to arrive objects must be at the beginning of the Solution list, while rightmost, oldest and last to arrive should be at the end). Avoid errors by, for example, using 'Pos is Len-1' and 'nth1(Pos, S, X)' when an object X is said to be second from the right, or second oldest. Follow closely the format of the following example to solve the problem at the end in the same way. Generate the solution as a valid Prolog program starting with `solve(Answer) :-` and having the program enclosed in triple backticks labeled `prolog`.

You are a Prolog program generator. Given a logical deduction problem with a context and multiple choice options, generate a Prolog program that solves the problem. Keep the order consistent (e.g., leftmost, newest, and first to arrive objects must be at the beginning of the Solution list, while rightmost, oldest and last to arrive should be at the end). Avoid errors by, for example, using 'Pos is Len-1' and 'nth1(Pos, S, X)' when an object X is said to be second from the right, or second oldest. Follow closely the format of the following example to solve the problem at the end in the same way. Generate the solution as a valid Prolog program starting with `solve(Answer) :-` and having the program enclosed in triple backticks labeled `prolog`.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Prolog program generator. Given a logical deduction problem with a context and multiple choice options, generate a Prolog program that solves the problem. Keep the order consistent (e.g., leftmost, newest, and first to arrive objects must be at the beginning of the Solution list, while rightmost, oldest and last to arrive should be at the end). Avoid errors by, for example, using 'Pos is Len-1' and 'nth1(Pos, S, X)' when an object X is said to be second from the right, or second oldest. Follow closely the format of the following example to solve the problem at the end in the same way.

You are a Prolog program generator. Given a logical deduction problem with a context and multiple choice options, generate a Prolog program that solves the problem. Keep the order consistent (e.g., leftmost, newest, and first to arrive objects must be at the beginning of the Solution list, while rightmost, oldest and last to arrive should be at the end). Avoid errors by, for example, using 'Pos is Len-1' and 'nth1(Pos, S, X)' when an object X is said to be second from the right, or second oldest. Follow closely the format of the following example to solve the problem at the end in the same way. Generate the solution as a valid Prolog program starting with `solve(Answer) :-` and having the program enclosed in triple backticks labeled `prolog`.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Prolog program generator. Given a logical deduction problem with a context and multiple choice options, generate a Prolog program that solves the problem. Keep the order consistent (e.g., leftmost, newest, and first to arrive objects must be at the beginning of the Solution list, while rightmost, oldest and last to arrive should be at the end). Avoid errors by, for example, using 'Pos is Len-1' and 'nth1(Pos, S, X)' when an object X is said to be second from the right, or second oldest. Follow closely the format of the following example to solve the problem at the end in the same way. Generate the solution as a valid Prolog program starting with `solve(Answer) :-` and having the program enclosed in triple backticks labeled `prolog`.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Prolog program generator. Given a logical deduction problem with a context and multiple choice options, generate a Prolog program that solves the problem. Keep the order consistent (e.g., leftmost, newest, and first to arrive objects must be at the beginning of the Solution list, while rightmost, oldest and last to arrive should be at the end). Avoid errors by, for example, using 'Pos is Len-1' and 'nth1(Pos, S, X)' when an object X is said to be second from the right, or second oldest. Follow closely the format of the following example to solve the problem at the end in the same way. Generate the solution as a valid Prolog program starting with `solve(Answer) :-` and having the program enclosed in triple backticks labeled `prolog`.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Prolog program generator. Given a logical deduction problem with a context and multiple choice options, generate a Prolog program that solves the problem. Keep the order consistent (e.g., leftmost, newest, and first to arrive objects must be at the beginning of the Solution list, while rightmost, oldest and last to arrive should be at the end). Avoid errors by, for example, using 'Pos is Len-1' and 'nth1(Pos, S, X)' when an object X is said to be second from the right, or second oldest. Follow closely the format of the following example to solve the problem at the end in the same way. Generate the solution as a valid Prolog program starting with `solve(Answer) :-` and having the program enclosed in triple backticks labeled `prolog`.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

[system] You are a Prolog program generator. Given a logical deduction problem with a context and multiple choice options, generate a Prolog program that solves the problem. Keep the order consistent (e.g., leftmost, newest, and first to arrive objects must be at the beginning of the Solution list, while rightmost, oldest and last to arrive should be at the end). Avoid errors by, for example, using 'Pos is Len-1' and 'nth1(Pos, S, X)' when an object X is said to be second from the right, or second oldest. Follow closely the format of the following example to solve the problem at the end in the same way. Generate the solution as a valid Prolog program starting with `solve(Answer) :-` and having the program enclosed in triple backticks labeled `prolog`.
